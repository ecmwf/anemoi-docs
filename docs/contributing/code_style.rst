########################
 Code Quality and Style
########################

We enforce consistent code style using pre-commit hooks. All code must
follow these guidelines:

*****************
 Code Formatting
*****************

#. We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

   -  Line length is 120 characters (not 79).

   -  Uses ``black`` for consistent formatting.

   -  Uses ``isort`` for import sorting with: - Single line imports. -
      Black-compatible formatting. - Project imports grouped under
      ``anemoi``.

#. Import organization:

   -  Imports are sorted using ``isort``.
   -  Force single-line imports.
   -  Group order: standard library, third-party, anemoi packages.

*********
 Linting
*********

We use ``ruff`` for code linting, which checks for:

-  Code style violations.
-  Potential bugs.
-  Complexity issues.
-  Best practices.

*********************
 Documentation Style
*********************

#. Documentation follows strict guidelines:

   -  RST files are formatted using ``rstfmt``.
   -  Docstrings must match function signatures (checked by ``docsig``).
   -  Sphinx documentation is linted (``sphinx-lint``).

*******************
 Pre-commit Checks
*******************

All code is automatically checked using pre-commit hooks that verify:

#. Code formatting: Black formatting. Import sorting. Line endings and
   trailing whitespace.
#. Code quality: No debugger statements. No merge conflicts. Type
   annotations. No blanket ``noqa`` statements.
#. Documentation: Docstring validation. RST formatting. Sphinx
   linting.

*******************
 File Organization
*******************

Proper file organization is crucial for maintaining a clean and
maintainable codebase. Follow these guidelines when adding new files or
modifying existing ones:

Directory Structure
===================

Place new files in the appropriate package directory:

   -  Core functionality goes in ``src/anemoi/<package_name>/``.
   -  Tests go in ``tests/``.
   -  Documentation in ``docs/``.
   -  Group related functionality together in the same module for better
      organisation and maintainability.

.. note::

   When adding new files, ensure they are properly included in
   ``__init__.py`` files if they should be part of the public API. Keep
   it minimal. Use ``__init__.py`` to define package-level exports using
   ``__all__``.

.. note::

Utility Functions Organization:
   -  Use ``utils.py`` only for package-specific helper functions that
      don't fit in other modules.

   -  If a utility function could be useful across multiple packages: -
      Move it to ``anemoi-utils`` package. - Document its
      general-purpose nature. - Ensure it remains stateless and
      reusable.

   -  Avoid using ``utils.py`` as a catch-all; if multiple related
      utilities emerge, consider creating a dedicated module.

File Structure
==============

Within each file:

#. Start with the license header and imports:

   -  Anemoi contributors license header.
   -  Standard library imports.
   -  Third-party imports.
   -  Local imports.

#. Follow with any module-level constants or configurations.

#. Define classes and functions in a logical order:

   -  Base classes before derived classes.
   -  Related functions grouped together.
   -  Public API before private implementations.

.. note::

   Use absolute imports within the package. Avoid wildcard (*) imports.

********************
 Naming Conventions
********************

#. Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose or functionality.

#. Files and Modules:

   -  Use lowercase with underscores

   -  Examples:

      -  ``reduced_gaussian_grid.py`` ✅
      -  ``ReducedGaussianGrid.py`` ❌
      -  ``rgrid.py`` ❌ (too vague)

#. Classes:

   -  Use PascalCase (CapWords)

   -  Examples:

      -  ``ReducedGaussianGridNodes`` ✅
      -  ``MultiScaleEdges`` ✅
      -  ``reduced_gaussian_grid_nodes`` ❌
      -  ``Rgn`` ❌ (too cryptic)

#. Functions and Variables:

   -  Use snake_case

   -  Use verbs for functions, nouns for variables

   -  Examples:

      -  ``calculate_edge_weights()`` ✅
      -  ``get_coordinates()`` ✅
      -  ``node_attributes`` ✅
      -  ``calculateEdgeWeights()`` ❌
      -  ``crds`` ❌ (too vague)

#. Constants:

   -  Use uppercase with underscores

   -  Examples:

      -  ``MAX_GRID_RESOLUTION`` ✅
      -  ``DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`` ✅
      -  ``MaxGridResolution`` ❌

#. Private Names:

   -  Prefix with single underscore for internal use

   -  Examples:

      -  ``_validate_input()`` ✅
      -  ``_cached_result`` ✅

#. Type Variables:

   -  Use CamelCase, preferably single letters or short names

   -  Examples:

      -  ``T`` ✅ (for generic type)
      -  ``NodeType`` ✅
      -  ``EdgeAttr`` ✅

#. Enums:

   -  Use CamelCase for enum class names

   -  Use UPPERCASE for enum members

   -  Examples:

      -  ``class NodeType(Enum):``
      -  ``SOURCE = "source"``
      -  ``TARGET = "target"``

#. Test Names:

   -  Prefix with ``test_`` (methods) or ``Test`` (classes).

   -  Be descriptive about what is being tested.

   -  Include the scenario and expected outcome.

   -  Examples:

      -  ``test_reduced_gaussian_grid_with_invalid_resolution`` ✅
      -  ``test_edge_builder_handles_empty_graph`` ✅
      -  ``test_coordinates_are_in_radians`` ✅
      -  ``testGrid`` ❌ (too vague)
      -  ``test1`` ❌ (meaningless)

.. note::

   Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood in the domain
   (e.g., ``lat``, ``lon`` for latitude/longitude). Clarity is more
   important than brevity.
