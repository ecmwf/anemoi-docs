########################
 Development Guidelines
########################

Please follow these development guidelines:

#. Open an issue before starting a feature or bug fix to discuss the
   approach with maintainers and other users.
#. Ensure high-quality code with appropriate tests, documentation,
   linting, and style checks. TODO: Add reference to tests
#. Follow the :ref:`branching-guidelines`.
#. Follow the :ref:`commit-guidelines`.

.. _branching-guidelines:

**********************
 Branching Guidelines
**********************

-  Use feature branches for new features (e.g., `feature/your-feature`)
-  Use fix branches for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/your-bug`)
-  Use a descriptive name that indicates the purpose of the branch
-  Keep branches up to date with `main` before opening a Pull Request

.. _commit-guidelines:

*******************
 Commit Guidelines
*******************

When making commits to the repository, please follow these guidelines:

#. Make small, focused commits with clear and concise messages.

#. Follow the `Conventional Commits guidelines
   <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/>`_. The format is:
   ``type[(scope)][!]: description``. For example:

   -  ``feat(training): add new loss function``
   -  ``fix(graphs): resolve node indexing bug``
   -  ``docs(readme): update installation steps``
   -  ``feat(models)!: change model input format`` (breaking change)
   -  ``refactor!: restructure project layout`` (breaking change)

   Common types include:

   -  ``feat``: New feature.
   -  ``fix``: Bug fix.
   -  ``docs``: Documentation only.
   -  ``style``: Code style changes.
   -  ``refactor``: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features.
   -  ``test``: Adding or modifying tests.
   -  ``chore``: Maintenance tasks.

   Add ``!`` after the type/scope to indicate a breaking change.

#. Use present tense and imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add
   feature" not "Added feature").

#. Reference relevant issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
   (e.g., "fix: resolve data loading issue #123").

While these commit message conventions are recommended for all branches
in Anemoi, they are strictly enforced only for commits to the ``main``
branch. This enforcement is particularly important as our automated
release process (`release-please
<https://github.com/googleapis/release-please>`_) relies on conventional
commits to generate changelogs and determine version bumps
automatically.

.. _pullrequest-guidelines:

*************************
 Pull Request Guidelines
*************************

When submitting Pull Requests (PRs), please follow these guidelines:

#. Open a draft Pull Request early in your development process. This
   helps:

   -  Make your work visible to other contributors.
   -  Get early feedback on your approach.
   -  Avoid duplicate efforts.
   -  Track progress on complex changes.

#. Fill the PR template completely, including:

   -  Clear description of the changes.
   -  Link to related issues using GitHub keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123").
   -  List of notable changes.
   -  Any breaking changes or deprecations.
   -  Testing instructions if applicable.

#. Ensure the PR title follows the :ref:`commit-guidelines`, as this
   will become the squash commit message when merged to ``main``.

#. Keep your PR focused and of reasonable size:

   -  One PR should address one concern.
   -  Split large changes into smaller, logical PRs.
   -  Update documentation along with code changes.

#. Before marking as ready for review:

   -  Ensure all tests pass locally.
   -  Address any automated check failures.
   -  Review your own changes.
   -  Update based on any feedback received while in draft.

#. When ready for review:

   -  Mark the PR as "Ready for Review"
   -  Request reviews from appropriate team members.
   -  Be responsive to review comments.
   -  Update the PR description if significant changes are made.

#. After approval:

   -  PRs are merged using squash merge to maintain a clean history.
   -  The squash commit message will use the PR title.

***************
 Documentation
***************

Ensure that changes are appropriately documented, both with respect to
docstrings and more extensive documentation, following the
:ref:`documentation-guidelines`.

*********
 Testing
*********

All code changes must include appropriate tests. For detailed testing
guidelines and examples, see :ref:`testing-guidelines`.

Key points:

#. Use pytest for all test cases.
#. Run tests locally before submitting PRs (``pytest``).
#. Add tests for both success and failure cases.

 Performance Considerations
****************************

Performance is critical in scientific computing. Follow these guidelines
to ensure efficient code:

Profiling and Monitoring
========================

Profile code to identify bottlenecks:

   -  Use ``cProfile`` for Python profiling.
   -  Use ``torch.profiler`` for PyTorch operations.
   -  Monitor memory usage with ``memory_profiler``.

Data Operations
===============

Optimize data handling:

   -  Use vectorized operations (NumPy/PyTorch) instead of loops.
   -  Batch process data when possible.
   -  Consider using ``torch.compile`` for PyTorch operations.
   -  Minimize data copying and type conversions.

Memory Management
=================

Be mindful of memory usage:

   -  Release unused resources promptly.
   -  Use generators for large datasets.
   -  Clear GPU memory when no longer needed.

Algorithm Optimization
======================

Choose efficient algorithms and data structures:

   -  Use appropriate data structures (e.g., sets for lookups).
   -  Cache expensive computations when appropriate.

.. note::

   Always benchmark performance improvements and document any critical
   performance considerations in docstrings. Balance code readability
   with performance optimizations.

************************
 Continuous Integration
************************

All unit tests are run automatically on our CI/CD pipeline for every
pull request after the initial review by maintainers. Ensure all tests
pass before submitting your PR.
